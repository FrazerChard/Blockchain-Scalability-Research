Blockchain scalability for smart contract systems using eUTXO model

This research critically analyses blockchain scaling solutions based on their ability to realistically balance the properties of the blockchain trilemma. We have concluded this research by outlining a gap in the current body of literature and implementation of scalability solutions. 
An extended UTXO transaction model is proposed to overcome challenges associated with implementing both layer one and layer two scaling solutions in a blockchain system. 
The examination of industry approaches is used to justify this direction and puts forth a basis for future work.
